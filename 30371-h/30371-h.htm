<h2>BY CHARLES L. FONTENAY</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Herbert</span> bowed with a muted
clank&mdash;indicating he probably
needed oiling somewhere&mdash;and
presented Alice with a perfect martini
on a silver tray. He stood holding
the tray, a white, permanent
porcelain smile on his smooth
metal face, as Alice sipped the
drink and grimaced.</p>

<p>"It's a good martini, Herbert,"
said Alice. "Thank you. But, dammit,
I wish you didn't have that everlasting
smile!"</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Miss Alice,
but I am unable to alter myself in
any way," replied Herbert in his
polite, hollow voice.</p>

<p>He retired to a corner and stood
impassively, still holding the tray.
Herbert had found a silver deposit
and made the tray. Herbert had
found sand and made the cocktail
glass. Herbert had combined God
knew what atmospheric and earth
chemicals to make what tasted like
gin and vermouth, and Herbert
had frozen the ice to chill it.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said Thera wistfully,
"it occurs to me it would be
better to live in a mud hut with a
real man than in a mansion with
Herbert."</p>

<p>The four women lolled comfortably
in the living room of their
spacious house, as luxurious as anything
any of them would have
known on distant Earth. The rugs
were thick, the furniture was overstuffed,
the paintings on the walls
were aesthetic and inspiring, the
shelves were filled with booktapes
and musictapes.</p>

<p>Herbert had done it all, except
the booktapes and musictapes,
which had been salvaged from the
wrecked spaceship.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose we'll ever escape
from this best of all possible
manless worlds?" asked Betsy, fluffing
her thick black hair with her
fingers and inspecting herself in a
Herbert-made mirror.</p>

<p>"I don't see how," answered
blond Alice glumly. "That atmospheric
trap would wreck any other
ship just as it wrecked ours, and
the same magnetic layer prevents
any radio message from getting out.
No, I'm afraid we're a colony."</p>

<p>"A colony perpetuates itself," reminded
sharp-faced Marguerite,
acidly. "We aren't a colony, without
men."</p>

<p>They were not the prettiest four
women in the universe, nor the
youngest. The prettiest women and
the youngest did not go to space.
But they were young enough and
healthy enough, or they could not
have gone to space.</p>

<p>It had been a year and a half
now&mdash;an Earth year and a half on
a nice little planet revolving around
a nice little yellow sun. Herbert,
the robot, was obedient and versatile
and had provided them with a
house, food, clothing, anything they
wished created out of the raw elements
of earth and air and water.
But the bones of all the men who
had been aspace with these four
ladies lay mouldering in the wreckage
of their spaceship.</p>

<p>And Herbert could not create a
man. Herbert did not have to have
direct orders, and he had tried once
to create a man when he had overheard
them wishing for one. They
had buried the corpse&mdash;perfect in
every detail except that it never
had been alive.</p>

<p>"It's been a hot day," said Alice,
fanning her brow. "I wish it would
rain."</p>

<p>Silently, Herbert moved from his
corner and went out the door.</p>

<p>Marguerite gestured after him
with a bitter little laugh.</p>

<p>"It'll rain this afternoon," she
said. "I don't know how Herbert
does it&mdash;maybe with silver iodide.
But it'll rain. Wouldn't it have been
simpler to get him to air-condition
the house, Alice?"</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," said Alice
thoughtfully. "We should have had
him do it before."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Herbert</span> had not quite completed
the task of air-conditioning
the house when the other
spaceship crashed. They all rushed
out to the smoking site&mdash;the four
women and Herbert.</p>

<p>It was a tiny scoutship, and its
single occupant was alive.</p>

<p>He was unconscious, but he was
alive. And he was a man!</p>

<p>They carted him back to the
house, tenderly, and put him to
bed. They hovered over him like
four hens over a single chick,
waiting and watching for him to
come out of his coma, while Herbert
scurried about creating and
administering the necessary medicines.</p>

<p>"He'll live," said Thera happily.
Thera had been a space nurse.
"He'll be on his feet and walking
around in a few weeks."</p>

<p>"A man!" murmured Betsy, with
something like awe in her voice. "I
could almost believe Herbert
brought him here in answer to our
prayers."</p>

<p>"Now, girls," said Alice, "we
have to realize that a man brings
problems, as well as possibilities."</p>

<p>There was a matter-of-fact hardness
to her tone which almost
masked the quiver behind it. There
was a defiant note of competition
there which had not been heard
on this little planet before.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked
Thera.</p>

<p>"I know what she means," said
Marguerite, and the new hardness
came natural to her. "She means,
which one of us gets him?"</p>

<p>Betsy, the youngest, gasped, and
her mouth rounded to a startled O.
Thera blinked, as though she were
coming out of a daze.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Alice. "Do
we draw straws, or do we let him
choose?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't we wait?" suggested
Betsy timidly. "Couldn't we wait
until he gets well?"</p>

<p>Herbert came in with a new thermometer
and poked it into the
unconscious man's mouth. He stood
by the bed, waiting patiently.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think we can," said
Alice. "I think we ought to have
it all worked out and agreed on, so
there won't be any dispute about it."</p>

<p>"I say, draw straws," said Marguerite.
Marguerite's face was thin,
and she had a skinny figure.</p>

<p>Betsy, the youngest, opened her
mouth, but Thera forestalled her.</p>

<p>"We are not on Earth," she said
firmly, in her soft, mellow voice.
"We don't have to follow terrestrial
customs, and we shouldn't. There's
only one solution that will keep
everybody happy&mdash;all of us and the
man."</p>

<p>"And that is...?" asked Marguerite
drily.</p>

<p>"Polygamy, of course. He must
belong to us all."</p>

<p>Betsy shuddered but, surprisingly,
she nodded.</p>

<p>"That's well and good," agreed
Marguerite, "but we have to agree
that no one of us will be favored
above the others. He has to understand
that from the start."</p>

<p>"That's fair," said Alice, pursing
her lips. "Yes, that's fair. But I
agree with Marguerite: he must be
divided equally among the four of
us."</p>

<p>Chattering over the details, the
hard competitiveness vanished from
their tones, the four left the sickroom
to prepare supper.</p>

<hr />

<p>After supper they went back in.</p>

<p>Herbert stood by the bed, the
eternal smile of service on his metal
face. As always, Herbert had not
required a direct command to accede
to their wishes.</p>

<p>The man was divided into four
quarters, one for each of them. It
was a very neat surgical job.</p>
